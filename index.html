          <h3> A Short Introduction:</h3>
          <p>Norbert Wiener (November 26, 1894 – March 18, 1964) was an American mathematician and philosopher. He was a professor of mathematics at MIT. Wiener is considered the originator of <b>cybernetics</b>, a formalization of the notion of feedback,
            with implications for engineering, systems control, computer science, biology, neuroscience, philosophy, and the organization of society.</p>
          <p>In his book
            <i>"Cybernetics"</i>(1948) he also created computer ethics, as philosophical research field, such as business ethics, or medical ethics. His works are still a main influence on the field today.</p>

          <h3>Character Testimony:</h3>
          <p>Many tales, perhaps apocryphal, were told of him at MIT, especially concerning his absent-mindedness. It was said that he returned home once to find his house empty. He inquired of a neighborhood girl the reason, and she said that the family
            had moved elsewhere that day. He thanked her for the information and she replied, "That's why I stayed behind, Daddy!"</p>
          <p> 1916 - Wiener was briefly a journalist for the Boston Herald, where he wrote a feature story on the poor labor conditions for mill workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts, but he was fired soon afterwards for his reluctance to write favorable articles
            about a politician the newspaper's owners sought to promote.</p>
